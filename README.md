# geo_hash_xy

A library for geohashing. This is used by elasticsearch and others for geo-queries.

This is a direct fork of geohash (https://pub.dev/packages/geohash) with some bug fixes as the project appears abandoned.

## Usage

A simple usage example:

    import 'package:geohash/geohash.dart';

    main() {
      var encoded = Geohash.encode(40,-120);
      var latLng = Geohash.decode(encoded);
    }
